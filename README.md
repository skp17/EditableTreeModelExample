This example shows how to implement a simple item-based tree model that can be used with other classes using the 
model/view framework. 

The model supports editable items, custom headers, and the ability to insert and remove rows and 
columns. 
With these features, it is also possible to insert new child items, and this is shown in the supporting example code.
